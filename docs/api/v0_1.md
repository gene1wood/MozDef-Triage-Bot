# MozDef Alert Triage Bot 0.1 API

This document describes the API served by the web server component of the
MozDef Alert Triage Bot.

## Conventions

Request and response bodies are described using
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html)
syntax to indicate the structure and types of data.

## Endpoints

### Notify of Alert

When an alert is triggered in MozDef, this endpoint is invoked to notify the
bot about it.  The response will indicate only whether or not the alert was
queued for processing.  The user's response will be communicated to the SQS
worker component.

**Request**

```
POST /alerts

{
  "identifier": string,
  "summary": string,
  "email": string
}
```

**Response**

Status Codes:

* `200` - The alert was queued for processing successfully.
* `503` - The server is unable to queue the alert at present.

No response body.

### Activity From Slack

When a user interacts with a message sent to them on Slack, Slack will send a
[request](https://api.slack.com/messaging/interactivity) to the web server
component indicating the user's response.

**Request**

```
POST /responses

...
```

**Response**

Status Codes:

* `200` - The response was processed successfully.
* `503` - The response could not be processed at present.

No response body.
