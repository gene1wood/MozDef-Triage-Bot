# MozDef Alert Triage Bot 0.1 Specification

The first release of the MozDef Alert Triage Bot will implement a minimum
viable product (MVP) containing features that will facilitate the automation
of the triaging process for a few specific MozDef alerts.  The portion of the
codebase that exists within this repository will provide an implementation for
only the component of the triage bot that facilitates interactions with users
on Slack.  This specification documents the design and requirements of those
components implemented within [MozDef](https://github.com/mozilla/mozdef)
itself, however the source code for those components will reside within
MozDef's own repository.

## User Stories

Version 0.1 must satisfy the following user stories.

As an incident responder, I want to be able to easily determine which of the
alerts emitted by MozDef will be handled automatically so that I can adjust to
not having to handle them.

As an incident responder, I want to know when the triage bot is already in
the process of investigating an alert so that I can determine when it is
not working as expected and not take on work I do not have to.

As a Mozillian, I would like to be contacted in a friendly and non-intrusive
way with information that explains in simple terms everything I need to
understand and know how to respond.

As one of Mozilla’s service operators, I would like to be able to easily
understand how the triage bot will interface with Slack so that I can
manage permissions.

As one of Mozilla’s service operators, I would like to be able to easily
determine who to reach out to with questions about the triage bot.

## Functional Components

### Web Server

The web server component has the responsibility of facilitating interactions
with Slack.  Within the scope of the v0.1 implementation, these interactions
will be limited to sending interactive messages to users on Slack and handling
notifications regarding user interactions from Slack.  This component, which
will serve as the bot user, has the following responsibilities:

1. Receive information about alerts from MozDef.
2. Send an interactive message to relevant user(s) on Slack.
3. Send information back to MozDef indicating how users responded.

The implementation of this component will reside in this repository.

### Alert Action

Within MozDef, an alert action would fire each time one of any supported events
are triggered.  This action would send some simple identifying information to
the web server component, along with the alert summary text to be forwarded on
to the relevant user.

The implementation of this component will reside within the
[MozDef](https://github.com/mozilla/mozdef) repository.

### SQS Worker

The end of the communication pipeline would be implemented as an SQS worker
designed to ingest messages from the web server component identifying an alert
and indicating the user(s)'s response.  This worker would update a new `status`
field associated with alerts via MozDef's REST API, which would also require an
additional endpoint.

The implementation of this component will reside within the
[MozDef](https://github.com/mozilla/mozdef) repository.

## Additional Requirements

### MozDef REST API Endpoint

In order for the SQS Worker component to update the status of an alert, an
endpoint will be added to MozDef's REST API to facilitate such updates.  This
endpoint would accept information identifying an alert to which one or more
users have responded as well as information indicating the response(s) given.

### MozDef Alerts Page UI

An addition will be made to MozDef's "Alerts" page, adding a column to the
existing table of alerts within which the `status` of the alert will be
displayed.  An alert's status will be one of a pre-defined set of statuses
and will communicate to incident responders whether the Triage Bot has
processed the alert.

## Data Models

The following models describe what data is required to implement the features
that each component is responsible for.  They are described using
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html)
syntax.

### Alert Triage Requests

Requests sent to the web server containing information identifying alerts are
described here.  The complete specification for the API endpoint resides in
the [API documentation](../api/v0_1.md).

```typescript
{
  // A unique identifier belonging to the alert.
  "identifier": string,

  // A textual description of the alert which will be sent to the user.
  "summary": string,

  // The email address of the user whose activity triggered the alert.
  "email": string
}
```

Version 0.1 of the Triage Bot will support alerting for only one user at a
time.

### User Response Messages

The web server component will present users with a simple interactive message
asking whether an alert was triggered by activity that user is aware of or not
and will also offer the option to indicate that they are the wrong user to
contact.  As such, JSON messages sent to the SQS worker will represent one of
these three responses to the question "was this you?"

```typescript
{
  // The unique identifier tied to the alert that was responded to.
  "identifier": string,

  // Indicates how the user responded, if they did so before a timeout.
  "response": "acknowledge" | "reject" | "invalid",
}
```

Since the SQS Worker component will respond to a `response` of `"invalid"` by
setting an alert's status to `manual`, this is the response that will be
indicated in the case where a user fails to respond before a timeout is
reached.

### Alert Statuses

In order to account for all of the states an alert can be in with regards to
being triaged by this bot, the following statuses are defined to make up a
complete set of all possible statuses that an alert can have.

* `manual` - Requires intervention by a human incident responder.
* `triage` - The alert is in the process of being triaged by the bot.
* `acknowledged` - The alert was acknowledged by the Mozillian / Contributor.
* `escalated` - The alert was escalated by the Mozillian / Contributor.

In the case where a user responds to a question with `invalid`, an alert's
status will be reverted back to `manual` from `triage`.

## Disclaimers

Future versions of the Triage Bot specification may want to account for some
cases and conditions that are not being addressed in v0.1.

### Authentication

At present, there is no means for the alert plugin component in MozDef to
authenticate itself to the web server component.  This means that anyone able
to send a well-formed request to the server could fill up the alert queue,
potentially halting functionality and incurring significant operation costs.
